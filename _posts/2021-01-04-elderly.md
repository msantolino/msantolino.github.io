Spain has recorded an increase on its number of elderly drivers due to an increase in this population cohort and, as in other countries, it will become more significant over the coming years.<br>

According to a recent [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2020.02.002) co-authored by Mercedes Ayuso and Miguel Santolino, based on data from 2016 provided by the Dirección General de Tráfico de España (Spanish Traffic Authority), the accident severity and the expected costs of accidents increase when the driver is over the age of 75. <br>
