[Loss Data Analytics](https://openacttexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) is an interactive, online, freely available text for the actuarial community. The idea behind the name Loss Data Analytics is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools.<br>
<br>
The project is promoted by [Edward (Jed) Frees](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/jed-frees/). The project goal is to have the actuarial community author the textbook in a collaborative fashion. <br>
<br>
Some members of the [Riskcenter](http://www.ub.edu/riskcenter/) research group we are collaborating in the [Spanish translation of the textbook](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDASpanish/).
